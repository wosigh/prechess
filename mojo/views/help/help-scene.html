<p>Castling, en-passent and pawn promotion are all catered for, but the rule "Game is drawn if a position repeats three times" is not implemented. The CPU performs an alpha-beta search to a depth of two moves, but does not examine check at the deepest level.

<p>Tap a piece to indicate that it should move. Tap a cell to drop it.

<p>Game log appears below the board.  Scroll to read it.
</p>
<p>This game's version of end-game strategy is to win before the end-game.
</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy it.  If you can improve the game engine, go for it!
